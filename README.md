# plantTracker Device

plantTracker Device is an Arduino-based hardware setup that enables real-time tracking of plant growth parameters, including soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature. The device is designed to be used in agriculture settings, particularly in regions with limited access to mechanization, such as Africa.

## Features

- Utilizes Arduino, GSM/GPRS module, soil moisture sensor, LDR (light-dependent resistor), and soil temperature tracker for collecting plant growth data.
- Real-time clock (RTC) chip for accurate timekeeping and timestamping of data.
- Data collection and transmission to a Django server for storage and analysis.
- Can be easily customized and expanded with additional sensors for more comprehensive plant monitoring.
- Trigger pumps or other devices remotely through the associated plantTracker mobile app built with React Native.

## Hardware Setup

The plantTracker device is configured with the following components:

- Arduino board
- GSM/GPRS module
- Soil moisture sensor
- LDR (light-dependent resistor)
- Soil temperature tracker
- Real-time clock (RTC) chip
